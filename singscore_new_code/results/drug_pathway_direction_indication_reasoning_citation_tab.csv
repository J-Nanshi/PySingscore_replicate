In a trial, patients with double PIK3CA-mutant tumors had an ORR ~30% on a PI3K inhibitor, vs ~18% for single mutantsdovepress.com.

Alpelisib,Estrogen receptor (ER) signaling (GO:0030520),Up,sensitive,"Moderate – Active ER signaling (HR+ status with wild-type ESR1) defines the context in which Alpelisib is used. ER-driven tumors with intact estrogen signaling rely on PI3K for growth crosstalk, and combining Alpelisib with endocrine therapy is effectivepubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.govdovepress.com. In contrast, tumors lacking ER activity (triple-negative) are not indicated for Alpelisib.

Alpelisib,RAS/RAF–MEK/ERK (MAPK) pathway (KEGG hsa04010),Down,sensitive,"Moderate – Lack of MAPK pathway activation (no RAS or BRAF oncogenic activity) leaves the PI3K pathway as the dominant survival route. Preclinical models show PI3K inhibitors are more efficacious when RAS/MAPK signaling is not driving growthmdpi.com. Conversely, co-activation of RAS–ERK can limit the response to PI3K/AKT inhibitorsmdpi.com, so its absence predicts greater sensitivity.","Browne & Okines, 2024; PMID: 38927964; DOI: 10.3390/cancers16122259; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38927964/"

Alpelisib,RAS/RAF–MEK/ERK (MAPK) pathway (KEGG hsa04010),Up,Resistance,"Moderate – Upregulation of the RAS–MAPK pathway provides an alternate proliferative signal that diminishes reliance on PI3K signalingmdpi.com. For example, oncogenic KRAS can drive AKT-independent growth; PI3K? inhibitors show limited effect in tumors co-driven by mutant RASmdpi.com. Clinically, concurrent RAS pathway activation is associated with poor response to PI3K inhibitors, often necessitating combination therapies to overcome pathway redundancy.","Browne & Okines, 2024; PMID: 38927964; DOI: 10.3390/cancers16122259; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38927964/"
Alpelisib,Receptor tyrosine kinase signaling (IGF?1R/Insulin) (GO:0008286),Up,Resistance,"Moderate – PI3K inhibition can relieve feedback suppression of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), causing hyperactivation of insulin receptor/IGF-1R and HER3 signalingmdpi.commdpi.com. This RTK upregulation sustains downstream PI3K/AKT and also triggers RAS/ERK pathways, blunting Alpelisib’s effectmdpi.com. Tumor cells with high insulin/IGF signaling (e.g. due to therapy-induced hyperglycemia or intrinsic IGF1R overexpression) can reactivate the PI3K pathway despite Alpelisib, leading to resistance.

Alpelisib,Estrogen receptor signaling (GO:0030520),Up,Resistance,"Moderate – ESR1 mutations that constitutively activate the ER pathway drive resistance to combined Alpelisib–endocrine therapydovepress.com. Even with PI3K inhibited, constitutively active ER signaling (due to mutations like Y537S or D538G in ER?) continues to fuel tumor growth, negating the benefit of Alpelisib. In a clinical study, emergent ESR1 mutations were associated with rapid progression on Alpelisib plus aromatase inhibitordovepress.com. Thus, ER pathway activation in a hormone-independent manner (or ER-negative status) predicts poor response to Alpelisib.","Razavi et al., 2020; PMID: 32864625; DOI: 10.1038/s43018-020-0047-1; https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32864625/"
Alpelisib,mTORC1 signaling (KEGG hsa04150),Up,Resistance,"Moderate – Hyperactivation of mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) downstream of PI3K is a common driver of resistance to Alpelisibnature.com. Persistent mTORC1 activity can maintain protein synthesis and survival signals even when PI3K is inhibited.

Doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cell lines and refractory tumors frequently have upregulated ABC transporters, leading to sub-therapeutic intracellular drug concentrations.","Thorn et al., 2011 (PMID:21048526; DOI:10.1097/FPC.0b013e32833ffb56; [PharmGKB]academia.edu); Gillet & Gottesman, 2012 (PMID:22217479; DOI:10.1038/nrc3260; URL)"
Doxorubicin,MAPK/ERK signaling (KEGG:hsa04010),Up,Resistance,"Moderate. Hyperactivation of ERK confers pro-survival advantages under genotoxic stress. Sustained MAPK/ERK activity helps tumor cells repair or tolerate DNA damage.

Doxorubicin,PI3K–AKT survival signaling (KEGG:hsa04151),Up,Resistance,"Moderate. Upregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway (e.g. via activating PIK3CA mutations or PTEN loss) promotes cell survival and therapy resistance. Clinically, tumors with PI3K pathway activation (often luminal subtypes) respond poorly to chemotherapy. Genomic analyses find PIK3CA among top mutations in anthracycline-resistant breast tumorsmdpi.com. PI3K/AKT activation can inhibit apoptosis and confers a cellular milieu less susceptible to doxorubicin-induced death. Co-inhibition of PI3K or mTOR has been explored to overcome this resistance.","Liu et al., 2022 (PMID:36553741; DOI:10.3390/biom12121834; [PubMed]mdpi.com); Yu et al., 2017 (PMID:28062820; DOI:10.18632/oncotarget.14140; URL)"
Doxorubicin,NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response (GO:0034599),Up,Resistance,"Moderate. Nrf2 (NFE2L2) is a transcription factor that upregulates antioxidant and detoxification genes. Its activation allows cancer cells to neutralize ROS and repair oxidative damage. Doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cells often show elevated Nrf2 activity; stimulation of Nrf2 signaling protects cells against DOX-induced cell deathmdpi.com. This diminishes the drug’s efficacy by mitigating ROS-mediated damage. Consistently, high expression of glutathione and related enzymes (regulated by Nrf2) correlates with chemoresistance, whereas Nrf2 inhibitors can resensitize cells in preclinical studies.","Mirzaei et al., 2021 (PMID:33810439; DOI:10.3390/antiox10030349; [MDPI]mdpi.com); Wang et al., 2017 (PMID:28118518; DOI:10.18632/oncotarget.14303; URL)"
Doxorubicin,Autophagy (macroautophagy – GO:0016236),Up,Resistance,"Moderate. Cytoprotective autophagy allows cancer cells to survive chemotherapy-induced stress by recycling damaged components. Doxorubicin can induce autophagy, which in turn blunts apoptotic response. Studies show that elevated autophagy activity leads to chemo-resistance by preventing cellular damage and inhibiting apoptosisbmccancer.biomedcentral.com. Inhibition of autophagy (e.g. with chloroquine or genetic knockdowns) has been shown to increase doxorubicin cytotoxicity in breast cancer models, highlighting autophagy as a resistance mechanism.","van der Zijden et al., 2020 (PMID:32709744; DOI:10.3389/fcell.2020.00468; URL); Nolte et al., 2021 (PMID:33627191; DOI:10.1186/s12964-021-00592-1; [Frontiers]bmccancer.biomedcentral.com)"
Doxorubicin,"Epithelial–Mesenchymal Transition (EMT, GO:0001837)",Up,Resistance,"Moderate. Activation of the EMT program (often via TGF-? signaling or loss of E-cadherin) is associated with chemoresistance. Mesenchymal-like breast cancer cells are more drug-tolerant and invasive. Acquisition of doxorubicin resistance in cell lines is accompanied by EMT marker changesbmccancer.biomedcentral.com. Clinically, tumors with an EMT phenotype (claudin-low subtype) respond poorly to chemo. Thus, an active EMT pathway (loss of epithelial traits) indicates likely resistance to doxorubicin therapy.","Batlle & Mangues, 2020 (PMID:32059752; DOI:10.1038/s41416-020-0746-8; URL); van den Hof et al., 2019 (PMID:31864338; DOI:10.1186/s12885-019-5939-z; [BMC]bmccancer.biomedcentral.com)"
Doxorubicin,DNA damage response deficiency (GO:0006974),Down,Resistance,"Moderate. Paradoxically, while DNA damage is doxorubicin’s aim, a complete failure of damage-checkpoint/apoptosis pathways can let cells survive with mutations. Tumors with defective TP53/p21 pathway often do not undergo apoptosis upon drug exposure. Clinical data show mutant TP53 status predicts anthracycline resistance and poorer outcomespubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Similarly, loss of mismatch repair or other repair factors can impede doxorubicin-induced cell death (allowing continued proliferation despite DNA lesions)academia.edu. Therefore, absence of key damage-response signals is associated with lack of benefit from doxorubicin.","Rahko et al., 2003 (PMID:12751374; DOI:10.1016/S0959-8049(02)00499-9; [PubMed]pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov); Kaye et al., 1985 (PMID:2982511; DOI:10.1007/BF00257753; URL)"
