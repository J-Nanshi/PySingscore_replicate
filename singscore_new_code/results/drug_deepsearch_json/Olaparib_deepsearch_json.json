  "drug_category": "DDR",
  "drug_class": "PARP inhibitor",
  "moa": "Olaparib binds and inhibits PARP1, PARP2, and PARP3, enzymes involved in single-strand DNA break repair. In breast cancer cells with BRCA1/2 mutations or other homologous recombination defects, PARP inhibition leads to accumulation of unrepaired single-strand breaks that collapse replication forks into lethal double-strand breaks. Olaparib also traps PARP-DNA complexes, preventing repair enzyme release and intensifying DNA damage. This synthetic lethal mechanism causes selective cancer cell death in tumors with homologous recombination deficiency.",
