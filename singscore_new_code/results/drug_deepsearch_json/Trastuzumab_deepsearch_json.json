  "drug_class": "monoclonal antibody",
  "moa": "Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds the extracellular domain of HER2/ERBB2 on tumor cells, preventing receptor dimerization and downstream signaling. This disrupts HER2-driven activation of PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways, inhibiting tumor growth. Trastuzumab binding also induces HER2 internalization and degradation. Importantly, its Fc region engages immune effector cells (NK cells and macrophages) to mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against HER2-overexpressing cancer cells.",

  "notes": "Trastuzumab is only effective in HER2-amplified breast cancer and has minimal activity in HER2-negative subtypes. Documented resistance mechanisms include PTEN loss and activating PIK3CA mutations. A single study found an upregulated cAMP-related gene set in responders (no standard pathway ID provided), and no consistent downregulated pathways were reported."
