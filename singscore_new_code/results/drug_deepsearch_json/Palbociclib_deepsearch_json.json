  "drug_class": "CDK4/6 inhibitor",
  "moa": "Palbociclib is a selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6, preventing phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and blocking the G1-to-S phase transition. In HR+ breast cancer, estrogen receptor signaling induces Cyclin D1, which activates CDK4/6 to inactivate Rb and promote cell proliferation. By inhibiting CDK4/6, palbociclib maintains Rb in its active, growth-suppressive state bound to E2F, enforcing G1 arrest and causing decreased expression of E2F target genes and DNA replication enzymes. This leads to a cytostatic G1 phase arrest rather than apoptosis, especially when combined with endocrine therapy.",
