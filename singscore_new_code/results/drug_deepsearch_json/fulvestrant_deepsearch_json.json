  "drug_category": "Hormonal therapy",
  "drug_class": "Selective estrogen receptor downregulator (SERD)",
  "moa": "Fulvestrant is a selective estrogen receptor downregulator (SERD) that binds to and accelerates the degradation of the estrogen receptor α (ERα). This causes complete blockade of estrogen signaling without any partial agonist activity, shutting off the ER-driven transcriptional program (for example, genes like GREB1 and PGR are downregulated). As a result, ER-positive breast cancer cells undergo cell-cycle arrest and decreased proliferation. Fulvestrant is administered by intramuscular injection and is used across ER-positive breast cancer subtypes, especially luminal (ER+/HER2-negative) tumors.",

    "Mechanism: ERBB (EGF/HER2) signaling activation provides alternate mitogenic signals. Effect: This bypasses ER dependence and undermines fulvestrant efficacy. Rationale: Upregulated growth factor signaling is a known resistance mechanism in endocrine therapy.",

    "Mechanism: RAS/MAPK pathway activation drives proliferation and survival. Effect: This diminishes fulvestrant’s anti-tumor effect by signaling through an ER-independent route. Rationale: Enhanced MAPK activity is commonly observed in endocrine-resistant breast cancers.",
    "Mechanism: E2F target gene upregulation indicates increased CDK4/6–Cyclin D1 activity. Effect: This sustains cell-cycle progression despite ER blockade. Rationale: Resistant tumors often maintain high E2F/cell-cycle activity to circumvent ER inhibition.",
    "Mechanism: G2/M checkpoint genes are upregulated, reflecting cell-cycle drive. Effect: This suggests continued division signals when ER is downregulated. Rationale: Fulvestrant-resistant cells exhibit persistently active cell-cycle checkpoint programs."

  "notes": "Fulvestrant is only effective in ER-positive breast cancer; it has no role in ER-negative (e.g., triple-negative) tumors because they lack the target. Most clinical evidence pertains to luminal (ER+/PR+) subtypes."
